# Aryaman's RenderRoom - Prototype

This is a Vite + React frontend prototype for **Aryaman's RenderRoom**.
It includes Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, a cursor trail, placeholder gallery, and a toggleable lofi ambient audio (placeholder file).

## How to run locally

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the address printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import project -> Upload -> select the ZIP (or connect your Git repo)
3. Deploy.

> Note: `public/lofi.wav` is a 2-second silent placeholder. Replace it with an actual lofi loop (named `lofi.wav`) under `public/` for the real ambient audio.
